            The taste of chapati is often described as wholesome, earthy, and slightly nutty making it a perfect pairing to your Chicken Biriyani.</p>  
        
            <p>The soft and chewy texture of chapati can provide a nice contrast to the aromatic and spiced rice dish.
            The contrast in textures, with the soft and chewy chapati alongside the flavorful and spiced rice, creates a well-balanced and satisfying meal experience. This combination not only brings together diverse flavors but also reflects the cultural traditions and culinary practices that make Indian cuisine so rich and diverse.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)</li>
                <li>Water (for kneading)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
                <li>Ghee or oil (for brushing, optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Dough:
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour. Optionally, add salt for taste.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add water while kneading the dough. Aim for a soft, smooth, and elastic consistency.</li>
                        <li>Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes to develop gluten. This helps in making the chapatis soft.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Rest the Dough:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This resting period allows the gluten to relax, making the dough easier to work with and the chapatis softer.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Divide the Dough:
                    <ul>
                        <li>After resting, divide the dough into golf ball-sized portions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Rolling the Chapatis:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take one portion of the dough and roll it into a smooth ball between your palms.</li>
                        <li>Dip the ball into dry flour and then roll it out into a thin, round disc on a floured surface. Aim for an even thickness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Cooking the Chapatis:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preheat a griddle or flat pan (tava) over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Place the rolled-out chapati onto the hot surface. Cook for about 20-30 seconds until you see bubbles forming.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Flipping and Cooking:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Flip the chapati using a spatula. It should have some brown spots on the cooked side.</li>
                        <li>Cook the other side for about 20-30 seconds.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Puffing (Optional):
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can try gently pressing the edges with a kitchen cloth, and the chapati might puff up. This step is optional but adds to the softness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li>Finishing Touch (Optional):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optionally, you can brush the cooked chapati with ghee or oil for added flavor.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
